        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.</p><br />
        <p>CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p><br />
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</p><br />
        <p>This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css
            file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>
        <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on
            Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>
        <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.</p><br />
        <p>This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p><br />
        <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).</p><br />
        <p>The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p><br />
        <p>In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.</p><br />
